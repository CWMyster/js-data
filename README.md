## Moonflower Feature
A new section was added to the HTML to feature an item from the menu.  

### Put the Data into JSON
Use the information below to write JSON to hold the featured items for the week. Store this in a separate JSON file. Each featured item has a name, image, and description.  There are two featured items this week, *but* there may be more later, so put them in an array and make sure that your JavaScript can process any number of featured items.

Item 1:

- name: "Hazelnut Cappuccino",
- image: "images/cappuccino.jpg",
- description: "A warm, soothing cappuccino with a touch of hazelnut to warm you as the weather turns."
        
Item 2:
- name: "Chocolate Cake",
- image: "images/choc-cake.jpg",
- description: "Our chocolate cake is rich, moist, and dark.  More chocolate to love."

### Use the Data to Show the Features
Use your JSON data to build and add HTML to show the two featured items in the “featured-items” div.  Create and add the HTML to the page using JavaScript.  The code that you write should be able to add any number of featured items to the page.
